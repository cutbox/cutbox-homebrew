      *** IMPORTANT ***

      Before running CutBox!

      $ open "x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.security?Privacy"

      i.e. System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy

      Add CutBox to both:  "Accessibility" and "Input Monitoring".

      This is so it can trigger a paste action.

      After you've added CutBox to these lists,
      you can start CutBox and enjoy.

      *** First Run ***

      You'll need to tell MacOS to allow CutBox to run, start the
      app and press OK at the prompt. Then go to...

      $ open "x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.security?General"

      i.e. System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General

      Click "Allow", then "Open" to allow CutBox to run.

      *** Allowing Software ***

      If you'd prefer to install any software you want to, without Apple's
      messages popping up at all, you can run:

      $ sudo spctl --master-disable

      Check System preferences, Security, you'll see that software can be
      Installed from anywhere. Note that all new software will still need
      YOUR permission to run.
