    <<~EOS
      CutBox installed to #{prefix}/CutBox.app

      Copy the app to /Applications

      cp -R #{prefix}/CutBox.app /Applications/

      alternatively symlink the app to /Applications
      (note: this won't be found Spotlight)

      ln -s #{prefix}/CutBox.app /Applications/

      *** IMPORTANT ***

      After copying to /Applications (before running CutBox)

      $ open -b com.apple.systempreferences /System/Library/PreferencePanes/Security.prefPane

      i.e. System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy

      Add CutBox to both:  "Accessibility" and "Input Monitoring".

      This is so it can trigger a paste action.

      After you've added CutBox to these lists,
      you can start CutBox and enjoy.
