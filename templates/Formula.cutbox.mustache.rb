      Copy the app to /Applications

      cp -R #{prefix}/CutBox.app /Applications/

      alternatively symlink the app to /Applications
      (note: this won't be found Spotlight)

      ln -s #{prefix}/CutBox.app /Applications/

      Open System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy

      Add CutBox to both:  "Accessibility" and "Input Monitoring".
